## Why?
Ghibli Land allows a user familiar with the films of Hayao Miyazaki to explore and let their imagination run wild. Ever thought about what Spirited Away would look like in the forest from Princess Mononoke? Me too. Play around with the characters, settings, and more, and then see if you can beat the Rotten Tomatoes scores of any of these famous films (hint, you probably won't ;))
